<h1>Developing a Program Using libctl</h1>

If you are thinking of using libctl in a program that you are writing,
you might be rolling your eyes at this point, thinking of all the work
that it will be.  A full programming language?  Complicated data
structures?  Information passing back and forth?  Surely, it will be a
headache to support all of these things.

<p>In fact, however, using libctl is much easier than writing your
program for a traditional, fixed-format input file.  You simply
describe in an abstract specifications file the variables and data
types that your program expects to exchange with the ctl file.  From
these specifications, code is automatically generated to export and
import the information to and from Guile.

<p>The specifications file is written in Scheme, and consists of
definitions for the classes and input/output variables the program
expects.  It may also contain any predefined functions or variables
that might be useful in ctl files for the program.

<h2>Defining input variables</h2>

To define an input variable (a variable specified by the ctl file and
input into the program), use the following construction:

<pre>
(define-input-var <i>name value type [ constraints ... ]</i>)
</pre>

<p>Here, <code><i>name</i></code> is the name of the variable, and
<code><i>value</i></code> is its initial value--so far, this is just
like a normal <code>define</code> statement.  However, input variables
have constraints on them, the simplest of which is that they have a
specific type.  The <code><i>type</i></code> parameter can be one of:

<ul>

<li><code>'number</code> - a real number

<li><code>'integer</code> - an integer

<li><code>'vector3</code> - a 3-vector

<li><code>'boolean</code> - a boolean value, <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>

<li><code>'string</code> - a string

<li><code>'<i>class</i></code> - an member of <code><i>class</i></code>

<li><code>(make-list-type <i>el-type</i>)</code> - a list of elements
of type <code><i>el-type</i></code>

</ul>

<p>Note that the quote before a type name is Scheme's way of
constructing a <b>symbol</b>, which is somewhat similar to a C
enumerated constant.

<p>The final argument is an optional sequence of constraints.  Each
constraint is a function that, given a value, returns
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on whether that
value is valid.  For example, if an input variable is required to be
positive, one of the constraints would be the <code>positive?</code>
function (predefined by Guile).  More complicated functions can, of
course, be constructed.

<p>Here are a few examples:

<pre>
(define-input-var dimensions 3 'integer positive?)
(define-input-var default-epsilon 1.0 'number positive?)
(define-input-var geometry '() (make-list-type 'geometric-object))
(define-input-var k-points '() (make-list-type 'vector3))
</pre>

<p>Notice that all input variables have initial values, meaning that a
user need not specify a value in the ctl file if the default value is
acceptable.  If you want to force the user to explicitly give a value
to a variable, set the initial value to <code>'no-value</code>.  (This
way, if the variable is not set by the user, it will fail the
type-constraint and an error will be flagged.)  Such behavior is
deprecated, however.

<h2>Defining output variables</h2>

Output variables, which are passed from the simulation to the ctl
script, are defined in a manner similar to input variables:

<pre>
(define-output-var <i>name type</i>)
</pre>

<p>Notice that output variables have no initial value and no
constraints.  Your C program is responsible for assigning the output
variables when it is called (as is discussed below).

<p>A variable can be both an input variable and an output variable at
the same time.  Such input-output variables are defined with the same
parameters as an input variable:

<pre>
(define-input-output-var <i>name value type [constraints]</i>)
</pre>

<h2>Defining classes</h2>

To define a class, one has to supply the parent class and the properties:

<pre>
(define-class <i>name parent [ properties... ]</i>)
</pre>

<p><code><i>name</i></code> is the name of the new class and
<code><i>parent</i></code> is the name of the parent class, or
<code>no-parent</code> if there is none.

<p>The <code><i>properties</i></code> of the class are zero or more of
the following definitions, which give the name, type, default value,
and (optional) constraints for a property:

<pre>
(define-property <i>name type default-value [ constraints... ]</i>)
</pre>

<p><code><i>name</i></code> is the name of the property.  It is okay
for different classes to have properties with the same name (for
example, both a sphere and a cylinder class might have
<code>radius</code> properties)--however, it is important that
properties with the same name have the same type.  The
<code><i>type</i></code> and optional <code><i>constraints</i></code>
are the same as for <code>define-input-var</code>, described earlier.

<p>If <code><i>default-value</i></code> is <code>no-default</code>,
then the property has no default value and users are required to
specify it.  To give a property a default value,
<code><i>default-value</i></code> should be of the form
<code>(make-default <i>value</i>)</code>, where
<code><i>value</i></code> is the default value.

<p>For example, this is how we might define classes for materials and
dielectric objects in an electromagnetic simulation:

<pre>
(define-class material-type no-parent
  (define-property epsilon 'number no-default positive?)
  (define-property conductivity 'number (make-default 0.0)))

(define-class geometric-object no-parent
  (define-property material 'material-type no-default)
  (define-property center 'vector3 no-default))

(define-class cylinder geometric-object
  (define-property axis 'vector3 (make-default (vector3 0 0 1)))
  (define-property radius 'number no-default positive?)
  (define-property height 'number no-default positive?))

(define-class sphere geometric-object
  (define-property radius 'number no-default positive?))
</pre>

<h2>Useful things to put in a specifications file</h2>

The specifications file is loaded before any user ctl file, making it
a good place to put definitions of variables and functions that will
be useful for your users.  For example, the electromagnetic simulation
might define a default material, <code>air</code>:

<pre>
(define air (make material-type (epsilon 1.0)))
</pre>

<p>You can also define functions (or do anything else that Scheme
allows), e.g. a function to duplicate geometric objects on a grid.
(See the <code>examples/</code> directory of libctl for an example of
this.)

<h2>Writing your program</h2>

Once the specifications have been written, you have to do very little
to support them in your program.

<p>First, you need to generate C code to import/export the
input/output variables from/to Guile.  This is done automatically by
the <code>gen-ctl-io</code> script in the <code>utils/</code>
directory:

<pre>
gen-ctl-io <i>specifications-file</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>gen-ctl-io</code> script generates two files,
<code>ctl-io.h</code> and <code>ctl-io.c</code>.  The former defines
global variables and data structures for the input/output variables
and classes, and the latter contains code to exchange this data with
Guile.

<p>Second, you should copy the <code>main.c</code> file from the
<code>examples/</code> directory.  This file defines a main program
that starts up Guile, loads control files from the command line, and
waits for a <code>(run)</code> command.  When <code>(run)</code> is
called in the ctl script, the input variables are imported into the C
program, the <code>run_program</code> function in <code>main.c</code>
is called, and then the output variables are exported.

<p>You merely need to modify <code>run_program</code>, then, to call
the "main" subroutine of your simulation.  When it is called, all of
the input variables and data structures are already filled in!  To
output data, you just assign values to the output variables, and they
will be automatically exported to Guile.

<p>For maximum convenience, you should also copy the
<code>Makefile</code> from <code>examples/</code>.  At the top of this
file, there are places to specify the location of libctl, your object
files and specification file, and your C compiler and flags. The
Makefile will then generate the <code>ctl-io</code> files and do
everything else needed to compile your program.

<h3>Data structures and types</h3>

The data structures for holding classes and other variable types are
defined automatically in <code>ctl-io.h</code>.  They are fairly
self-explanatory, but it should be noted that they use some data types
defined in <code>src/ctl.h</code>, mostly mirrors of the corresponding
Scheme types.  (e.g. <code>number</code> is a synonym for
<code>double</code>, and <code>vector3</code> is a structure with
<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> fields.)
(<code>ctl.h</code> also declares several functions for manipulating
vectors, e.g. <code>vector3_plus</code>.)

<h3>Allocating and deallocating data</h3>

The input variables are allocated and deallocated automatically, as
necessary, but you are responsible for allocating and deallocating the
output data.  As a convenience, the function
<code>destroy_output_vars()</code> is defined, which deallocates all
of the output data pointed to by the output variables.  You are
responsible for calling this when you want to deallocate the output.

<p>Typically, after each run, you will want to (re)allocate and assign
the output variables.  To avoid memory leaks, however, you should
first deallocate the old output variables on runs after the first.  To
do this, use the following code:

<pre>
if (num_runs > 1)  /* on first run, outputs haven't been allocated yet */
     destroy_output_vars();

/* ... allocate & assign the output variables ... */
</pre>

<p>The global variable <code>num_runs</code> is automatically set to
the number of calls to the <code>(run)</code> function (it is
<code>1</code> during the first call).

<p>Remember, you are <b>required</b> to assign all of the output
variables to legal values, or the resulting behavior will be
undefined.

<h3>Advanced possibilities</h3>

Once you become comfortable with Guile and libctl, you should consider
allowing more entry points into your program.  That is, you should
enable the user to call other functions in your program besides the
main <code>run_program</code> subroutine.

<p>For more information on how to do this, consult the Guile
documentation.  You will need to modify the function
<code>declare_functions</code> in <code>main.c</code> to notify Guile
of your subroutines.  Also, you might want to set up a Scheme function
that exchanges the input and output data before and after your
subroutine is called.  For example, we already have a
<code>(run)</code> function that calls <code>run_program</code> as
follows:

<pre>
(define (run)
  (check-vars input-var-list)    ; check the input variables
  (read-input-vars)              ; import the input variables to C
  (run-program)                  ; call run_program
  (write-output-vars))           ; export the output variables from C
</pre>

<p>Have fun!

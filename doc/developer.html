<h1>Developing a Program Using libctl</h1>

If you are thinking of using libctl in a program that you are writing,
you might be rolling your eyes at this point, thinking of all the work
that it will be.  A full programming language?  Complicated data
structures?  Information passing back and forth?  Surely, it will be a
headache to support all of these things.

<p>In fact, however, using libctl is much easier than writing your
program for a traditional, fixed-format input file.  You simply
describe in an abstract specifications file the variables and data
types that your program expects to exchange with the ctl file.  From
these specifications, code is automatically generated to export and
import the information to and from Guile.

<h1 align=center>libctl</h1>

Welcome to the manual for <b>libctl</b>, a Guile-based library 
implementing flexible control files for scientific simulations!

This documentation is divided into the following sections, which you
should read roughly in order if you are new to libctl:

<h2><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></h2>

The introductory section describes the motivation, history, and
high-level structure of libctl.

<h2><a href="basic-user.html">Basic User Experience</a></h2>

Here, we disuss what a basic <b>ctl</b> control file looks like.  From
this perspective, ctl is just another control-file format with lots of
parentheses.

<h2><a href="advanced-user.html">Advanced User Experience</a></h2>

The advanced user can take advantage of the fact that the ctl file is
actually a Scheme program running in a full interpreter (called
Guile).  Literally anything is possible, especially since the
simulation program can support dynamic passing of information back and
forth with the control file.

<h2><a href="user-ref.html">User Reference</a></h2>

A compact listing of the various functions provided for the user by
libctl.

<h2><a href="developer.html">Developer Experience</a></h2>

libctl is powerful for the developer, too.  One merely specifies an
abstract <b>specification file</b> that describes the information that
is exchanged with the ctl file, and nearly everything else is
automatic.

<h2><a href="guile-links.html">Guile Information</a></h2>

Guile is a standard GNU program for adding scripting and extensibility
to software.  It implements an embeddable interpreter for the Scheme
language.  There are many places that you can go to learn more about
Guile and Scheme, and we link to a few of them here.

<h2><a href="license.html">License and Copyright</a></h2>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Scientific software for performing large computations is typically
managed using textual control files that specify the parameters of the
computation.  Historically, these control files have typically
consisted of long, inflexible collections of numbers whose meaning and
format is hard-coded into the program.  With <b>libctl</b>, we make it
easy for programmers to support a greatly superior control file
structure, and with less effort than was required for traditional
input formats.

<p>The "ctl" in "libctl" stands for <i>Control Language</i> (by
convention, libctl control files end with ".ctl" and are referred to
as ctl files).  Thus, libctl is the <i>Control Language Library</i>
(where the "lib" prefix follows the Unix idiom).

<h2>Design Principles</h2>

The libctl design has the following goals:

<ul>

<li><b>Input readability</b>: The control file should be
self-annotating and human-readable (as opposed to an inscrutable
sequence of numbers).  Of course, it should allow comments.

<li><b>Input flexibility</b>: The control file should not be sensitive
to the ordering or spacing of the inputs.

<li><b>Input intelligence</b>: The user should never have to enter any
information that the program could reasonably infer.  For example,
reasonable defaults should be available wherever possible for
unspecified parameters.

<li><b>Flexibility</b>: It should be easy to add new parameters and
features to the control file without breaking older control files or
increasing complexity.

<li><b>Scriptability</b>: Simple things should be simple, but complex
things should be possible.  The control file should be more than just
a file format.  It must be a programming language, able to script the
computation and add new functionality without modifying the simulation
source code.

<li><b>Programmer Convenience</b>: All of this power should not come
at the expense of the programmer.  Rather, it should be easier to
program than ever before--the programmer need only specify the
interaction with the control file in an abstract form, and everything
else should be taken care of automatically.

</ul>

<p>All of these goals are achieved by libctl with the help of Guile, the
GNU scripting and extensibility language.  Guile does all of the hard
work for us, and allows us to embed a complete interpreter in a
program with minimal effort.

<p>Despite its power, libctl is designed to be easy to use.  A basic
user only sees a convenient file format...with a programming language
to back it up if her needs become more complex.  For the programmer,
all headaches associated with reading input files are lifted--once an
abstract specification is supplied, and interaction with the user is
handled automatically.

<p>In the subsequent sections of this manual, we will discuss in more
detail the interaction of the user and the programmer with libctl.

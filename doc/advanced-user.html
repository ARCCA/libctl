<h1>Advanced Control Files</h1>

Many more things can be accomplished in a control file besides simply
specifying the parameters of a computation, and even that can be done
in a more sophisticated way than we have already described.  The key
to this functionality is the fact that the ctl file is actually
written in a full programming language, called Scheme.  This language
is interpreted and executed at run-time using an interpreter called
Guile.  The fact that it is a full programming language means that you
can do practically anything--the only limitations are in the degree of
interaction supported by the simulation program.

<p>In a <a href="guile-links.html">later section</a>, we provide links
to more information on Scheme and Guile.

<h2><a name="interactive">Interactive Mode</a></h2>

The easiest way to learn Scheme is to experiment.  Guile supports an
interactive mode where you can type in commands and have them executed
immediately.  To get into this mode, you can just type
<code>guile</code> at the command-line.

<p>If you run your libctl program without passing any arguments, or
pass a ctl file that never invokes <code>(run)</code>, this will also
drop you into a Guile interactive mode.  What's more, all the special
features supported by libctl and your program are available from this
interactive mode.  So, you can set parameters of your program, invoke
it with <code>(run)</code>, get help with <code>(help)</code>, and do
anything else you might otherwise do in a ctl file. It is possible
that your program supports other calls than just <code>(run)</code>,
in which case you could control it on an even more detailed leve.

<h2>Programmatic Parameter Setting</h2>

A simple use of the programmatic features of Scheme is to give you
more power in assigning the variables in the control file.  You can
use arithmetic expressions, loops and functions, or define your own
variables and functions.

<p>For example, consider the following case where we set the
<code>k-points</code> of a band-structure computation.  We define the
corners of the Brillouin zone, and then call a libctl-provided
function, interpolate, to linearly interpolate between them.

<pre>
(define Gamma-point (vector3 0 0))
(define X-point (vector3 0.5 0))
(define M-point (vector3 0.5 0.5))
(set! k-points (list Gamma-point X-point M-point Gamma-point))
(set! k-points (interpolate 4 k-points))
</pre>

<p>The resulting list has 4 points interpolated between each pair of
corners:

<blockquote><code>
 (0,0,0) (0.1,0,0) (0.2,0,0) (0.3,0,0) (0.4,0,0) (0.5,0,0) (0.5,0.1,0)
 (0.5,0.2,0) (0.5,0.3,0) (0.5,0.4,0) (0.5,0.5,0) (0.4,0.4,0)
 (0.3,0.3,0) (0.2,0.2,0) (0.1,0.1,0) (0,0,0)
</code></blockquote>

<p>The <code>interpolate</code> function is provided as a convenience
by libctl, but you could have written it yourself if it weren't.  With
past programs, it has often been necessary to write a program to
generate control files--now, the program can be in the control file
itself.

<h2>Interacting with the Simulation</h2>

So far, the communication with the simulation program has been
one-way, with us passing information to the simulation.  It is
possible, however, to get information back.  The <code>(help)</code>
command lists not only input variables, but also <i>output</i>
variables--these variables are set by the simulation and are available
for the ctl program to examine after <code>(run)</code> returns.

<p>For example, a band-structure computation might return a list of
the band-gaps.  Using this, the ctl file could vary, say, the radius
of a sphere and loop until a band-gap is maximized.

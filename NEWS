libctl 2.2

  * Added simple trapezoidal-rule adaptive numeric integration routine.

  * Numerical derivative routines now allow numerical differentation
    of vector-valued function.  Added deriv2 convenience routine.

  * Added find-root-deriv functions for faster root-finding of
    functions for which the derivative is also available.

  * Added missing (cvector3 ...) constructor, and fixed corresponding
    constructor for cvector3 object properties; thanks to Doug Allan for
    the bug report.

  * Added generic 'memoize' function.

  * libctl programs now print out command-line parameters when they run.

  * Fixed incomplete support for generic SCM type.

  * Fixed to work with Guile 1.5+ (thanks to Mike Watts for the bug report).

libctl 2.1 (3/21/2002)

  * Bug fix: complex-number input variables were read as garbage
    if they had imaginary parts; does not affect complex-number outputs.

  * Added generic SCM type for i/o variables and parameters, as a
    catch-all for other Scheme objects.

  * main.c now has ctl_export_hook (enabled by defining
    CTL_HAVE_EXPORT_HOOK) with which to define additional Guile symbols.

  * gen-ctl-io: converts "!" in symbols to "B" in C identifiers.

libctl 2.0 (3/10/2002)

  * New set-param! function, analogous to define-param, that allows
    you to change the value of a parameter in a way that can still be
    overridden from the command line.

  * In libgeom, allow user to specify the resolution instead of the
    grid-size.  New no-size support in lattice class to reduce
    dimensionality, and new (get-grid-size) function.

  * Support for Scheme complex numbers, along with a few new associated
    functions: conj, vector3-cdot, matrix3x3-adjoint.

  * New functions to compute numerical derivatives using Ridder's
    method of polynomial extrapolation.

  * Documented object-property-value; thanks to Theis Peter Hansen for
    the suggestion.

  * Get rid of unneeded make-default, and use consistent syntax for
    define-property and define-post-processed-property, compared to
    define-input-var.  NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE (for developers; users
    are not affected).  Thanks to Theis Peter Hansen for the suggestion.

  * Call ctl_stop_hook even with --help, --version, etcetera; this
    makes the behavior nicer e.g. with MPI.

libctl 1.5 (11/15/2001)

  * geometry-lattice now has a separate basis-size property, so that you
    can specify the basis vectors as being something other than unit vectors.

  * More functions are tail-recursive, helping to prevent stack overflows;
    thanks to Robert Sheldon for the bug report.

  * New fold-left and fold-right functions, documented in the manual.

  * The configure script now checks that guile is in the $PATH.  Thanks to
    Bing Li and Giridhar Malalahalli for their bug reports.

libctl 1.4.1 (7/4/2001)

  * Support function lists.

libctl 1.4 (2/23/2001)

  * Renamed "display-many" function to more felicitous "print"
    and added "print-ok?" global variable that allows you
    to disable program output.

  * Added support for passing 'function types back and forth
    (just a SCM object pointing to a Scheme function).

  * Cosmetic fixes to yes/no? and menu-choice interaction functions.

  * Support start/exit hooks for use e.g. with MPI.

libctl 1.3 (1/7/2001)

  * Added improved "subplex" multidimensional optimization algorithm
    (for maximize-multiple and minimize-multiple).

  * Documented vector3-x, vector3-y, vector3-z functions for extracting
    vector3 components.

libctl 1.2 (7/9/2000)

  * Added new "cone" geometric object type.

  * Added reciprocal->cartesian, cartesian->lattice, lattice->reciprocal,
    etcetera functions to libgeom for converting vectors between bases.

  * Added routines rotate-vector3 and rotation-matrix3x3 for rotating vectors.

  * Added support for returning lists from external functions.

  * Fixed bug in matrix3x3-inverse function.

  * Fixed bug in find-root for converging to negative roots.

  * Use Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm for multi-dimensional minimization
    (it seems to be more robust than the old routine).

libctl 1.1.1 (1/28/2000)

  * Use CPPFLAGS environment variable instead of the less-standard
    INCLUDES to pass -I flags to the configure script (for header files
    in non-standard locations).

  * Compilation fixes.  We need to set SHELL in the Makefile for make on
    some systems.  Also added rule to insure ctl-io.h is created before
    main.c is compiled.  Thanks to Christoph Becher for the bug reports.

libctl 1.1 (1/2/2000)

  * geom: radius and height of objects is now permitted to be zero.

  * geom: material_of_point_* routines now report whether the point
    is in any object; necessary for use with MPB 0.9.

  * Added man page for gen-ctl-io, based on a contribution by
    James R. Van Zandt.

libctl 1.0.1 (11/22/1999)

  * geom: handle case where ensure-periodicity is false.

  * geom: bug fix in geometric-objects-lattice-duplicates for
    non-orthogonal lattices; thanks to Karl Koch for the bug report.

libctl 1.0 (11/19/1999)

  * Initial public release.

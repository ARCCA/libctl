.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
." Add any additional description here
.B gen-ctl-io
generates C code to import/export the input/output
variables used in a libctl control file.
.B gen-ctl-io
generates two files, \fIctl-io.h\fP and \fIctl-io.c\fP.  These files define global variables, data structures, and functions for the input/output variables, classes, and function interfaces defined in the
.I spec-file
argument, automating the interaction between C and Guile.

libctl is a free library to aid in interfacing scientific software
with the GNU Guile scripting and extension language.  Documentation
for it may be found online at the libctl home page:

This is libctl, a parser and interpreter library for the ctl
control-file language.

We use GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension, a
library implementation of the Scheme language plus various convenient
facilities. Guile is designed so that you can link it into an
application or utility to make it extensible.  You can find out more
about Guile at:

	Unofficial Guile Home Page: http://www.red-bean.com/guile/
	GNU Project Guile Page: http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html

To get started, you might want to look at examples/README.

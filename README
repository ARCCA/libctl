This is libctl, a Guile-based library for supporting flexible control
files in scientific simulations.  libctl is copyright (c) 1998 by
Steven G. Johnson.

To install libctl, one normally only needs to do:

./configure
make
make install

Files are installed under /usr/local by default, but this can be
changed by passing --prefix=<dir> to configure.

Documentation can be found in the doc/ directory, and an example
program in the examples/ directory.  The main source code for libctl
is in the base/ and utils/ directories.

In utils/geom.*, you can find specification files and functions for
dealing with structures consisting of solid geometric objects in some
lattice basis.  The example program uses this code.

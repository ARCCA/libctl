This is libctl, a parser and interpreter library for the ctl
control-file language.

It uses GUILE, GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension, is
a library implementation of the Scheme language plus various
convenient facilities. It's designed so that you can link it into an
application or utility to make it extensible.  You can find out more
